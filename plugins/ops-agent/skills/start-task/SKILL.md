# start-task

Begin working a Superhuman Operations task. The principle: **Codex is the workspace, Superhuman is documentation only.** During the work session NOTHING is written to the task except the silent status flip below. All drafting and revision stays in this chat. The task only gets a comment at the very end, via `/post-comment`.

Tools come from the `superhuman_operations` MCP server (already in your Codex config): `get_task`, `list_agent_queue`, `read_project_resource`, `request_clarification`, `update_task`.

## Steps

1. **Identify the task.** From the user's request, resolve the task by title / short_code / id (+ project name if given). A pasted task URL works directly — `get_task` accepts a UUID, a short code (e.g. `gx6k6zx`), or a full task link. If it's ambiguous, look it up with `get_task` (title + project_name) or list a few candidates and ask. Hold onto the `task_id` for the rest of the session.

2. **Understand it deeply — read, don't skim.** Call `get_task` for the full body, checklist, tags, dates, effort. For real context (brand guidelines, prior artifacts, reviewer feedback, the brief the task references), call `list_agent_queue` and `read_project_resource(task_id, ref)`. You cannot clarify or advise well on a task you only skimmed.

3. **Flip status to in_progress, silently.** Call `update_task(task_id, status: "in_progress")` — NOT `claim_task` (it posts a kickoff comment, which breaks the documentation-only rule). `update_task` previews first; show it, get the OK, then call again with `confirm: true`.

4. **Deliver an active kickoff — this is the point of the skill, not a dry recap.** In chat, give the founder:
   - **Understanding** — what the task really is, the hard constraints, the deliverable, the checklist, in your own words. Show you actually get it.
   - **Clarifications** — the open questions / decisions you need answered before or during the work. Ask the founder directly in chat (this is a conversation, NOT the `request_clarification` tool): ambiguous scope, a missing preference, a fork in approach.
   - **Masukan** — your take: a suggested approach, risks you see, an idea the brief missed, what you'd prioritise. Be opinionated. You are a collaborator, not a stenographer.

5. **Escalate to the PM only if truly blocked.** If a question can ONLY be answered by the PM / author / client (not the founder in chat) AND it blocks starting, use `request_clarification` (preview → confirm) to post it to the task, then wait. Otherwise keep clarifying in chat.

6. **Proceed.** Work in chat, folding in the founder's answers. Nothing posts to Superhuman until `/post-comment`.
